Answering of this question: https://github.com/BLT-blueskytech/QA-Test-Bluesky?tab=readme-ov-file#questions-answer-briefly

Why did you choose these test cases to automate?
- For Menu Automation i test all the navbar using page.locator # or id because its the most critical elements in the html
that differentiate each nav button

- For Asset Automation::broken_image my test case is searching the img who has naturalwidth > 0. naturalwidth is a html dom property that can tell if image 
loaded correctly or not
- For Asset Automation::css or js loaded, i check when js or css content is not returning 400, if its returning 400 then it means the js or css is
not loaded correctly

What did you choose not to automate, and why?

How would you maintain or scale these tests as the website grows?
: Maybe i would do Page object models for redundant command like
```
    page.goto("https://blsky.tech/", timeout=60000)
    page.wait_for_selector("img", timeout=10000)
```
or Add another helper so in test files i would just focus on assertion and acceptance criteria inside the file test
